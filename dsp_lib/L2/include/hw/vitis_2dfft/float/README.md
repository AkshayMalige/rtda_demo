# DSP Library â€“ L2 2D FFT (Floating Point)

This is the single-precision variant of the 2D FFT header set from AMD's Vitis DSPlib. We vendor it inside the project so AI Engine builds can resolve DSPlib interfaces without relying on external checkouts.

## Project Usage

- Resolved through the `DSPLIB_PATH` environment variable exported by `set_envs.sh`.
- Currently unused by the dense network, but available for future DSP experiments.
