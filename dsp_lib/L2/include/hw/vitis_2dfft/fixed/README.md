# DSP Library â€“ L2 2D FFT (Fixed Point)

Fixed-point 2D FFT headers from the AMD Vitis DSP library live here. The AI Engine demo keeps this content so that simulation and hardware builds are reproducible without pulling DSPlib separately.

## Project Usage

- Included automatically when `DSPLIB_PATH` points to `<repo>/dsp_lib`.
- Not instantiated by the dense network today, yet retained for completeness and future proofing.
